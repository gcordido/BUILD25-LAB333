# Lab 333: Evaluating Reasoning Models for your Generative AI Solutions


!!! info "**Duration**: 75 minutes"
    This workshop gives you a hand-on introduction to reasoning models from core concepts to practical usage in Azure AI Foundry. It has been created for use in both instructor-led (in-venue) and self-paced (at-home) usage. 

## Learning Objectives

This workshop is designed to jumpstart your journey into understanding, and working with, reasoning models in generative AI. By the end of the journey you should be able to:

1. Explain what reasoning models are, and how they work
1. Deploy and explore reasoning models using Azure AI Foundry and GitHub
1. Build intution for usage with low-code and code-first approaches
1. Gain insights into patterns and practices for practical applications


## Pre-Requisites

1. GitHub Account - you can [signup](https://github.com/signup) for free.
1. Azure Account - you can [signup](https://github.com/signup) for free.
1. Familiarity with Python programming & Ju[yter notebooks
1. Familiarity with VS Code editors & commandline usage
1. Familiarity with Generative AI applications and concepts

## Lab Outline

The content is structured in two parts - a core "Workshop" track with a bonus "Homework" track. The workshop track can be completed within 75 mins and is structured as four sections:

1. **Setup**: Create an Azure AI Foundry project with model deployments. Validate your setup.
1. **Introduction**: Understand how reasoning models differ from general-purpose large language models. Build intuition for the tradeoffs made when choosing between them.
1. **Ideation**: Start exploring model options in the Azure AI Foundry playground without code. Build intuition for reasoning effort and the impact it has on model performance.
1. **Inference**: Move to a development enviroment for code-first exploration of scenarios. Build intuition for good and bad use cases, and best practices for prompting.

The homework track provides bonus content to help you continue the journey at your own pace. It will be updated over time - for now, it has one section:

1. **Implementation**: Think about how these learnings translate to building a real-world application. Build intuition for patterns and practices for efficient usage.


## Keep Learning

This workshop is designed to be a living resource to continue your learning journey.

1. Walk away with a sandbox (and notebooks) that you can use, to experiment with application ideas, or to explore advanced reasoning concepts.
1. Star or watch the repo for updates. We'll continue to add new labs and scenarios to keep pace with the fast-growing set of models and capabilities for reasoning.
