# Building a Reasoning Application

!!! info "THIS IS NOT A LAB EXERCISE - IT IS A THOUGHT EXERCISE TO INSPIRE YOU"

    This section is not meant to completed in-venue. 
    
    It is meant for you to read and think about, in how reasoning models can be used to build more effective applications. **This entire track was created by a reasoning model** using the prompt below. The code or content has **not been tested or validated** but is shown exactly as generated, to give you a sense of how these models can be used **to plan your next application**

    Build a Reasoning Model Application - apply prompt engineering best practices to a complex scenario. In this section, we want to build a complex catering application that, given a set of recipes, and a set of catering orders, will generate a catering plan that covers ingredient purchase, recipe adjustments (for servings), and timing requirements.
    Talk about how we can use the reasoning models to help us with this task.
    - Explain metaprompting 
    - Explain orchestration (where reasoning model plans and gpt model executes)

    ```

    **Look at the content generated in this track**

    - How coherent is the writing?
    - How comprehensive is the planning?
    - How accurate are the explanations?
    - How runnable is the code?
    - How can using this as a starting point help productivity?
    - What aspects of app development _are good targets for reasoning?_

This section applies everything you've learned to build a practical application that leverages reasoning models. You'll develop a catering planning system that demonstrates how to effectively use reasoning capabilities to solve complex planning and optimization problems.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will be able to:

- Design applications that effectively leverage reasoning model capabilities
- Implement advanced prompting techniques specifically designed for reasoning models
- Orchestrate multiple models based on their strengths and cost profiles
- Handle complex planning problems with multiple constraints
- Build robust, production-ready solutions using Azure AI Foundry

## Topics Covered

1. [Project Overview](./01.md) - Understand the catering application requirements and architecture
2. [Metaprompting Techniques](./02.md) - Learn advanced prompting strategies for reasoning models
3. [Model Orchestration](./03.md) - Implement a system where reasoning models plan and GPT models execute

## Application Components

The catering planning application includes several core components:

- **Recipe Processor**: Parses and adjusts recipes based on guest count
- **Shopping List Generator**: Consolidates ingredients across multiple recipes
- **Timeline Creator**: Plans preparation schedules with dependencies
- **Resource Optimizer**: Allocates kitchen resources efficiently

## Approach

This section takes a project-based approach, guiding you through the process of building a practical application. You'll implement core components, integrate reasoning models, and create a cohesive system that demonstrates the real-world value of reasoning capabilities.

Begin with the first topic to start building your reasoning-powered application.
