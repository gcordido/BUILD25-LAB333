# Project Overview: Catering Planning Application

In this section, we'll apply what we've learned about reasoning models to build a practical application: a sophisticated catering planning system. This project demonstrates how reasoning models can tackle complex problems with multiple constraints, planning requirements, and optimization needs.

## Application Purpose

The Catering Planning Application helps catering businesses efficiently plan events by:

1. Processing recipes and adjusting servings based on guest count
2. Generating comprehensive shopping lists with consolidated ingredients
3. Creating detailed preparation timelines with dependencies
4. Optimizing resource allocation for multiple concurrent events
5. Planning kitchen workflow to maximize efficiency

This represents the type of complex planning challenge where reasoning models excel over traditional software approaches or simpler AI models.

## Core Functionality

### Recipe Processing

The application needs to:
- Parse recipe ingredient lists and instructions
- Adjust quantities for different serving sizes
- Identify common ingredients across multiple recipes
- Account for inventory already on hand

### Shopping List Generation

The system will:
- Consolidate ingredients across all recipes for an event
- Convert between different units of measurement
- Group ingredients by store department
- Optimize purchasing by suggesting bulk buys when appropriate

### Timeline Creation

The application should:
- Determine preparation order based on recipe dependencies
- Calculate preparation and cooking times
- Identify tasks that can be done in advance
- Schedule activities to minimize wait times and ensure all dishes are ready simultaneously

## Technical Architecture

Our application will use a layered architecture:

1. **Data Layer**: JSON files representing recipes, inventory, and orders
2. **Processing Layer**: Python code for data manipulation and model orchestration
3. **AI Layer**: Calls to Azure AI Foundry reasoning models for complex planning
4. **Output Layer**: JSON and text outputs representing plans and schedules

## Model Roles

We'll leverage different models for specific tasks:

- **Claude (o1)**: High-level planning and complex reasoning (with high reasoning level)
- **Claude 3 Mini (o3-mini)**: Intermediate tasks like recipe adjustments (with medium reasoning level)
- **GPT-4o Mini**: Quick operations like unit conversions (with low/no explicit reasoning)

This approach demonstrates effective orchestration of models based on their strengths.

## Development Approach

We'll build this application incrementally:

1. First implement core recipe processing functionality
2. Then add shopping list generation capabilities
3. Integrate timeline planning functions
4. Finally, connect components into a cohesive system

Throughout development, we'll explore techniques for:
- Prompt engineering specific to reasoning models
- Effectively decomposing complex problems
- Building robust error handling and validation
- Optimizing performance and cost through model selection

## Data Structures

### Recipe Format

Recipes will be stored as JSON objects with a structure similar to:

```json
{
  "name": "Classic Beef Lasagna",
  "serves": 8,
  "prep_time": 45,
  "cook_time": 60,
  "total_time": 120,
  "ingredients": [
    {"name": "ground beef", "quantity": 2, "unit": "lb"},
    {"name": "lasagna noodles", "quantity": 12, "unit": "sheets"},
    // additional ingredients...
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Brown the ground beef in a large skillet...",
    "Layer the bottom of the baking dish with noodles...",
    // additional steps...
  ],
  "equipment": ["large skillet", "baking dish", "mixing bowl"]
}
```

### Order Format

Catering orders will be defined as:

```json
{
  "event_id": "E12345",
  "client": "Northwind Traders",
  "date": "2025-05-15",
  "guests": 45,
  "meal_type": "dinner",
  "recipes": ["Classic Beef Lasagna", "Caesar Salad", "Garlic Bread"],
  "special_requirements": "Three vegetarian options needed"
}
```

## Success Criteria

By the end of this section, you will have built a catering planning application that:

1. Successfully processes recipes and adjusts for different serving sizes
2. Generates accurate, consolidated shopping lists
3. Creates logical preparation timelines with dependencies
4. Demonstrates effective use of reasoning models for complex planning tasks
5. Shows how to orchestrate multiple models based on task requirements

This practical application integrates all the concepts covered throughout the workshop and provides a template for building your own sophisticated reasoning-powered applications.

In the next section, we'll explore advanced prompting techniques specifically designed for reasoning models.
