# Building a Reasoning Application

This section applies everything you've learned to build a practical application that leverages reasoning models. You'll develop a catering planning system that demonstrates how to effectively use reasoning capabilities to solve complex planning and optimization problems.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will be able to:

- Design applications that effectively leverage reasoning model capabilities
- Implement advanced prompting techniques specifically designed for reasoning models
- Orchestrate multiple models based on their strengths and cost profiles
- Handle complex planning problems with multiple constraints
- Build robust, production-ready solutions using Azure AI Foundry

## Topics Covered

1. [Project Overview](./01.md) - Understand the catering application requirements and architecture
2. [Metaprompting Techniques](./02.md) - Learn advanced prompting strategies for reasoning models
3. [Model Orchestration](./03.md) - Implement a system where reasoning models plan and GPT models execute

## Application Components

The catering planning application includes several core components:

- **Recipe Processor**: Parses and adjusts recipes based on guest count
- **Shopping List Generator**: Consolidates ingredients across multiple recipes
- **Timeline Creator**: Plans preparation schedules with dependencies
- **Resource Optimizer**: Allocates kitchen resources efficiently

## Approach

This section takes a project-based approach, guiding you through the process of building a practical application. You'll implement core components, integrate reasoning models, and create a cohesive system that demonstrates the real-world value of reasoning capabilities.

Begin with the first topic to start building your reasoning-powered application.
