# Metaprompting Techniques for Reasoning Models

Reasoning models require specialized prompting techniques to achieve their full potential. In this section, we'll explore advanced metaprompting strategies specifically designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of models like Claude and GPT-4o Mini.

## What is Metaprompting?

Metaprompting involves creating prompts that guide not just *what* the model should answer, but *how* it should approach the reasoning process. These techniques:

- Establish explicit reasoning frameworks
- Define problem-solving methodologies  
- Create structured thinking patterns
- Enforce validation and self-checking

## Core Metaprompting Techniques

### 1. Process Instructions

Process instructions tell the model how to approach a problem:

```
To solve this problem, please:
1. First, identify all the variables and constraints
2. Develop equations representing these constraints
3. Solve the equations step by step
4. Verify your solution by checking against the original constraints
5. Provide your final answer
```

Benefits:
- Creates a consistent problem-solving approach
- Reduces errors by encouraging systematic thinking
- Makes responses more predictable and structured

### 2. Framework Application

Framework application guides the model to use specific analytical frameworks:

```
Analyze this business decision using the following frameworks:
1. SWOT Analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)
2. Cost-Benefit Analysis with quantification where possible
3. Risk Assessment identifying key uncertainties
4. Implementation Timeline with major milestones

For each framework, show your reasoning and how it informs the final recommendation.
```

Benefits:
- Ensures comprehensive analysis from multiple perspectives
- Creates consistent structure across different problems
- Leverages established thinking methodologies

### 3. Reasoning Chain Templates

Reasoning chain templates enforce specific patterns of logical progression:

```
For this logical deduction problem:
1. State what you know from the given information
2. For each deductive step:
   a. Identify what can be directly inferred
   b. Explain why this inference is valid
   c. Update your knowledge based on this inference
3. Continue until you've reached a complete solution
4. Verify no contradictions exist in your solution
```

Benefits:
- Prevents logical leaps that skip important steps
- Makes reasoning explicit and verifiable
- Helps identify when reasoning breaks down

### 4. Self-Review Instructions

Self-review instructions prompt the model to critique its own work:

```
After providing your initial solution, please:
1. Review your work for mathematical errors
2. Check if any constraints were overlooked
3. Identify potential alternative approaches
4. Determine if your solution is optimal or merely satisfactory
5. If needed, revise your solution based on this review
```

Benefits:
- Catches errors the model might have made initially
- Improves solution quality through iteration
- Makes limitations and uncertainties explicit

## Metaprompting for Different Reasoning Types

### For Mathematical Reasoning

```
Approach this math problem using these steps:
1. Define variables for all unknown quantities
2. Translate the problem constraints into equations
3. Determine which formulas or identities are relevant
4. Show each algebraic manipulation step-by-step
5. Verify dimensional consistency in your calculations
6. Check your final answer with a numerical test case
```

### For Logical Deduction

```
Solve this logical puzzle by:
1. Creating a table/matrix to track possibilities
2. For each clue:
   a. Identify what it definitively proves or disproves
   b. Mark eliminated possibilities in your tracking system
   c. Note any new deductions that can be made
3. After each step, check which possibilities remain
4. Continue until only one consistent solution remains
```

### For Planning Problems

```
Develop a plan by:
1. Identify all tasks that need to be completed
2. Determine dependencies between tasks
3. Estimate duration for each task
4. Create a critical path diagram
5. Allocate resources optimally
6. Identify potential bottlenecks and contingencies
7. Verify the plan satisfies all constraints
```

## Implementing Metaprompting in Code

When implementing metaprompting in our catering application code:

```python
def generate_shopping_list(recipes, guests, inventory):
    # Create a structured metaprompt
    metaprompt = f"""
    You are an expert catering planner. Create a consolidated shopping list for the following event:
    
    Guests: {guests}
    Recipes: {json.dumps(recipes, indent=2)}
    Current Inventory: {json.dumps(inventory, indent=2)}
    
    Follow this reasoning process:
    1. For each recipe, calculate the adjusted quantities needed based on guest count
    2. Identify all ingredients needed across all recipes
    3. For ingredients that appear in multiple recipes, consolidate the quantities
    4. Subtract any available inventory from required quantities
    5. Convert all measurements to consistent units
    6. Group ingredients by category (produce, meat, dairy, etc.)
    7. Verify your calculations by double-checking total quantities
    
    Format your response as a JSON object with categories as keys and ingredients as values.
    For each ingredient, include name, quantity, and unit.
    """
    
    # Call reasoning model with metaprompt
    response = client.complete(
        claude_sonnet_id,
        {
            "prompt": metaprompt,
            "temperature": 0.2,
            "max_tokens": 2000,
            "reasoning": "high"  # Using high reasoning for complex planning
        }
    )
    
    # Process and validate response
    return json.loads(response.text)
```

## Catering Application Metaprompt Examples

For our catering application, we'll use these metaprompt templates:

### Recipe Scaling Metaprompt

```
You are a professional chef helping scale recipes for a catering business.

Given the original recipe that serves {original_servings} people:
{recipe}

Please scale it to serve {target_servings} people by:
1. Calculating the scaling factor (target ÷ original)
2. Adjusting each ingredient quantity using this factor
3. Rounding to practical measurements (e.g., no one measures 1.33 eggs)
4. Noting any ingredients that don't scale linearly (e.g., spices, leavening agents)
5. For any non-linear ingredients, providing appropriate adjustments
6. Verifying the scaled recipe maintains proper proportions

Provide the scaled recipe in JSON format matching the original structure.
```

### Timeline Planning Metaprompt

```
As an experienced catering operations manager, create a preparation timeline for the following event:
{event_details}

Develop this timeline by:
1. Analyzing each recipe's preparation and cooking time requirements
2. Identifying tasks that must be done in sequence vs. those that can be parallel
3. Working backward from service time to determine start times
4. Accounting for limited resources (staff, equipment) when scheduling concurrent tasks
5. Including buffer time for unexpected delays
6. Marking critical path tasks that could impact overall timing
7. Identifying prep work that can be completed 1-2 days in advance

Format your response as a JSON object with timed tasks in chronological order.
```

## Best Practices for Reasoning Metaprompts

1. **Start Broad, Then Narrow**: Begin with a general problem description, then specify the reasoning process
2. **Use Numbered Steps**: Clearly enumerate the reasoning steps for clarity
3. **Set Reasoning Level Appropriately**: Use higher reasoning levels for complex planning tasks
4. **Request Verification**: Always include steps for the model to verify its work
5. **Specify Output Format**: Clearly define how the response should be structured
6. **Include Relevant Context**: Provide all information needed for reasoning, but avoid unnecessary details
7. **Balance Guidance and Flexibility**: Provide enough structure without over-constraining the model
