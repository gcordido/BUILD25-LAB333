title: Lab 7 · Code-First Prompting
description: Run Jupyter Notebooks
---

!!! quote "BY THE END OF THIS SECTION YOU SHOULD HAVE"

    1. Successfully run your first code-first reasoning prompt from Jupyter notebooks
    1. Understood the token counts and performance impacts of reasoning vs. general-purpose models
    1. Explored various text scenarios interactively to build intuition for code-first usage
    1. A "sandbox" notebook that you can quickly use to explore scenarios & prompt engineering

---

## Get Started With Notebooks

In this section we'll run the first Jupyter notebook and verify that our code-first development environment is ready. Then simply complete the exercises in the notebook directly.

1. Open the VS Code editor to the `notebooks` folder.
1. Click on `01-text-reasoning.ipynb`
1. When open, click **Select Kernel** and select the default Python environment.
1. Run the cells _one-by-one_ for maximum understanding

## Build Your Intuition

Try extending the notebook with your own examples or modify the configuration of existing ones, to build intuition for how this impacts the cost, accuracy, and latency, for response generation. Think of problems in areas like:

- Logic and deduction: `A farmer has 17 sheep. All but 9 run away. How many are left?` - this is about ability to interpret word problems, and not the math itself.
- Cause and effect: `If the power goes out during a storm, what are three possible consequences in a modern household?` - tests causal reasoning and practical inference
- Pattern recognition: `A dog is to bark as a cat is to __?` - tests analogy and associative reasoning
- Counterfactual or hypothetical thinking: `Imagine a world where people needed 4 hours of sleep. What would change in education and work life?`

## Generate Prompt Ideas

You can even try asking a general-purpose model to generate a few ideas for you. **Remember that these models are not perfect** - assess the examples for yourself. Here's a sample prompt I use - and the kinds of responses it created.

!!! info "Give me 10 examples of reasoning prompts that are good for o4-mini. Give me examples for math, science, multi-step planning and constraint-based scheduling"


## ➗ **Math Reasoning Prompts**

1. **“A train travels at 60 mph. How long does it take to travel 90 miles?”**  
   *(Basic rate/time/distance reasoning.)*

2. **“Jane has twice as many apples as Tom. Together they have 18 apples. How many does each person have?”**  
   *(Simple algebraic setup requiring translation from words to equations.)*

3. **“A rectangle has a perimeter of 36 cm. If the length is twice the width, what are the rectangle's dimensions?”**  
   *(Tests geometry and equation solving.)*

## 🔬 **Science Reasoning Prompts**

4. **“Why does a metal spoon feel colder than a wooden spoon when left in the same room?”**  
   *(Tests understanding of thermal conductivity and sensory perception.)*

5. **“If you double the mass of an object, how does that affect the force needed to accelerate it at the same rate?”**  
   *(Applies Newton's Second Law: F = ma.)*

6. **“What would happen to a plant placed in a dark room for 10 days, and why?”**  
   *(Encourages explanation of photosynthesis and light dependency.)*

## 📋 **Multi-Step Planning Prompts**

7. **“You need to plan a 3-day conference. List the major steps to take from now until the event, including choosing a venue, speakers, and marketing.”**  
   *(Tests ability to sequence actions with dependencies.)*

8. **“Design a basic weekly study schedule to learn Python in 6 weeks, assuming 1 hour per weekday.”**  
   *(Combines time management, curriculum planning, and prioritization.)*

## ⏳ **Constraint-Based Scheduling**

9. **“You have 4 tasks: A (2 hrs), B (1 hr), C (3 hrs), D (2 hrs). You have 5 hours available today. Task A must come before C. What’s a valid schedule?”**  
   *(Tests ability to honor constraints and fit within a time window.)*

10. **“Three employees—Alex, Sam, and Riley—must each work one 4-hour shift today. Only Alex and Riley can work before noon, and Sam can’t work past 4 PM. Create a valid schedule.”**  
   *(Combines logic, constraints, and scheduling.)*
