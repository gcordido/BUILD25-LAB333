# Working with Jupyter Notebooks

This section introduces the Jupyter notebooks we'll use to explore Azure AI Foundry models programmatically. We'll cover how to navigate, execute, and modify notebook content to get the most from the hands-on exercises.

## Jupyter Notebook Basics

Jupyter notebooks are interactive documents that combine executable code, visualizations, and narrative text in a single document. If you're new to Jupyter, here's what you need to know:

### Notebook Structure

Each notebook consists of a series of cells, which can be:

- **Code cells**: Contain executable Python code
- **Markdown cells**: Contain formatted text, headings, lists, and other documentation
- **Output cells**: Display the results of executed code (automatically created)

### Navigating Notebooks

When you open a notebook in VS Code:

1. The notebook interface appears with code and markdown cells
2. A toolbar at the top provides controls for running cells
3. Each cell has its own execution controls on the left side

### Cell Execution

To execute a code cell:

1. Click inside the cell to select it
2. Click the "Play" button on the left side of the cell, or
3. Press `Shift+Enter` to execute the cell and move to the next one
4. Press `Ctrl+Enter` to execute the cell and stay on the same cell

For best results, execute cells in order from top to bottom, as later cells often depend on variables and functions defined in earlier cells.

## Workshop Notebooks Overview

The workshop includes two main notebooks:

### 1. 01-getting-started.ipynb

This introductory notebook covers:

- Configuring the environment
- Creating a model inference client
- Basic model invocation
- Comparing model responses for simple questions
- Exploring model performance metrics (tokens, latency)

### 2. 02-reasoning-scenarios.ipynb

This advanced notebook focuses on:

- Testing models on reasoning-intensive scenarios
- Analyzing performance across different problem types
- Comparing reasoning levels
- Visualizing performance metrics
- Developing strategies for model selection

## Notebook Execution Flow

When working through the notebooks, follow this general flow:

1. **Start with setup cells**: Execute environment setup and package import cells first
2. **Read markdown explanations**: Each code section is preceded by markdown explaining its purpose
3. **Execute code sequentially**: Run cells in order to ensure dependencies are properly established
4. **Observe outputs**: Study the results, comparing different models and approaches
5. **Experiment with modifications**: Feel free to adjust parameters and prompts to see how they affect results

## Modifying the Notebooks

You're encouraged to experiment with the notebooks by:

1. **Changing model parameters**: Adjust temperature, max tokens, or reasoning levels
2. **Modifying prompts**: Try different questions or rephrase existing ones
3. **Adding new scenarios**: Create additional test cases for specific domains
4. **Extending visualizations**: Create new charts to highlight interesting patterns
5. **Adding your own code**: Experiment with new approaches to model interaction

## Saving Your Work

As you work through the notebooks:

1. **Automatically saved**: VS Code automatically saves your changes to the notebooks
2. **Download option**: If you want a local copy, use File > Save As to download the notebook
3. **Output preservation**: Notebook outputs are saved along with the cells, so you can review results later

## Common Issues and Solutions

If you encounter problems with the notebooks:

1. **Cell execution order**: If you see unexpected errors, restart the kernel and run all cells from the beginning
2. **Missing variables**: Ensure you've run all preceding cells that define necessary variables
3. **Authentication errors**: Check that your `.env` file is properly configured
4. **Package errors**: If missing packages, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal
5. **Kernel crashes**: If the kernel crashes, restart it from the VS Code interface

## Next Steps

With this understanding of how to work with Jupyter notebooks, you're ready to begin the practical coding exercises. In the next section, we'll start with basic model inference and comparison using our first notebook.
