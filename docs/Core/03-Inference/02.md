## Get Started With Notebooks

In this section we'll run the first Jupyter notebook and verify that our code-first development environment is ready. Then simply complete the exercises in the notebook directly.

1. Open the VS Code editor to the `notebooks` folder.
1. Click on `02-advanced-reasoning.ipynb`
1. When open, click **Select Kernel** and select the default Python environment.
1. Run the cells _one-by-one_ for maximum understanding

## Build Your Intuition

Try extending the notebook with your own examples or modify the configuration of existing ones, to build intuition for how this impacts the cost, accuracy, and latency, for response generation. Think of problems in areas like:

1. Location Recognition - "Where is this?" with a photo from a travel guide
1. Decipher Old Books or Paintings - "What does this say?" with hieroglyphics
1. Create a game - "Code angry bird - but with emojis vs. bugs"
1. Debug an error - "What is the issue here?" - but with a screenshot of the error
1. Solve a game - "Can black win?" - with a screenshot of a chess game in progress
