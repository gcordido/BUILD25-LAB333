!!! success "Congratulations! You just completed the Reasoning Lab333 at Microsoft Build"

You now have a repository you can continue to explore at home, with your own ideas. Here are a couple of suggestions to help you keep going!

## How to Generate Ideas

Still trying to understand what a good reasoning prompt could be? Try asking a general-purpose model to generate a few ideas for you. 

!!! quote "TRY THIS PROMPT YOURSELF"

      Give me 10 examples of reasoning prompts that are good for o4-mini. Give me examples for math, science, multi-step planning and constraint-based scheduling

**Remember that these models are not perfect** - assess the examples for yourself. Below are some of the examples it generated for me.

## How to Evaluate Ideas

!!! quote "HOMEWORK: Try these out in your notebook sandbox - then experiment with modifications!"

### 5.1 ➗ **Math + Reasoning**

1. **“A train travels at 60 mph. How long does it take to travel 90 miles?”**  
   *(Basic rate/time/distance reasoning.)*

2. **“Jane has twice as many apples as Tom. Together they have 18 apples. How many does each person have?”**  
   *(Simple algebraic setup requiring translation from words to equations.)*

3. **“A rectangle has a perimeter of 36 cm. If the length is twice the width, what are the rectangle's dimensions?”**  
   *(Tests geometry and equation solving.)*

### 5.2 🔬 **Science + Reasoning**

4. **“Why does a metal spoon feel colder than a wooden spoon when left in the same room?”**  
   *(Tests understanding of thermal conductivity and sensory perception.)*

5. **“If you double the mass of an object, how does that affect the force needed to accelerate it at the same rate?”**  
   *(Applies Newton's Second Law: F = ma.)*

6. **“What would happen to a plant placed in a dark room for 10 days, and why?”**  
   *(Encourages explanation of photosynthesis and light dependency.)*

### 5.3 📋 **Multi-Step + Planning**

7. **“You need to plan a 3-day conference. List the major steps to take from now until the event, including choosing a venue, speakers, and marketing.”**  
   *(Tests ability to sequence actions with dependencies.)*

8. **“Design a basic weekly study schedule to learn Python in 6 weeks, assuming 1 hour per weekday.”**  
   *(Combines time management, curriculum planning, and prioritization.)*

### 5.4 ⏳ **Constraint + Scheduling**

9. **“You have 4 tasks: A (2 hrs), B (1 hr), C (3 hrs), D (2 hrs). You have 5 hours available today. Task A must come before C. What’s a valid schedule?”**  
   *(Tests ability to honor constraints and fit within a time window.)*

10. **“Three employees—Alex, Sam, and Riley—must each work one 4-hour shift today. Only Alex and Riley can work before noon, and Sam can’t work past 4 PM. Create a valid schedule.”**  
   *(Combines logic, constraints, and scheduling.)*
