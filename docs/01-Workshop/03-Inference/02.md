!!! quote "BY THE END OF THIS SECTION YOU SHOULD HAVE"

    1. Learned to explore more visual reasoning problems
    1. Learned to modify reasoning effort via the API call
    1. Leared to explore other capabilities with reasoning

!!! info "REMINDER: These models are stochastic. Your response may not match the sample exactly"

## Explore Advanced Use

!!! quote "OBJECTIVE: Explore richer API capabilities. Build intuition usage in advanced scenarios"

1. Open the VS Code editor to the `notebooks` folder.
1. Click on `02-advanced-reasoning.ipynb` using instructions above.
1. Verify all cells ran without error.

**Now, let's talk about what you learned in this notebook**

1. We saw how you can use capabilities like Structured Outputs
1. We saw how the API can be tailored for Developer Messages
1. We saw additional use cases for Visual Reasoning
1. We set the notebook up for rapid ideation using these features

## Build Your Intuition


!!! quote "OBJECTIVE: Put these learnings to use with these notebooks as your sandbox!"

    1. Each notebook has a final cell with an area for you to try your own prompt
    1. Fill in a prompt - and run **just that cell**. Observe outcome
    1. Try changing parameters - **observe impact on response and token costs**
    1. Build intuition for a specific model or use case - by trying things out!

Think of problems in areas like:

1. **Location Recognition** - "Where is this?" with a photo from a travel guide
1. **Decipher Old Books or Paintings** - "What does this say?" with hieroglyphics
1. **Create a game** - "Code angry bird - but with emojis vs. bugs"
1. **Debug an error** - "What is the issue here?" - but with a screenshot of the error
1. **Solve a game** - "Can black win?" - with a screenshot of a chess game in progress
