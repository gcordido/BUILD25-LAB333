## Prompting Principles

First, let's review [recommended prompting practices](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning-best-practices#how-to-prompt-reasoning-models-effectively) for these models.

1. Use developer messages to set context.
2. Keep prompts clear and direct.
3. Avoid chain-of-thought; models reason internally.
4. Use delimiters to separate sections.
5. Try zero-shot first; add examples only if needed.
6. Clearly state any output constraints.
7. Be precise about goals and success criteria.
8. Include “Formatting re-enabled” to request markdown output.
 
!!! quote "**Over the rest of this workshop, we'll follow a basic practice.**"

      - Describe a use case or scenario
      - Start with a simple (and potentially messy) prompt. 
      - Think about applying at least one prompting principle to refine it.
      - Assess the impact in terms of quality, token costs and latency.

**This will help you gradually build up intuition for when to apply each principle effectively**.

## Use Case: Math Tutor

First, let's define a scenario. We know the reasoning models are good at math and logic, and the o-series models are notably good at competitive math challenges. Let's use that.


!!! info "Scenario: I am a Math tutor trying to help USA Computing Olympiad students"

      1. Here's an example of a [USA Computing Olympiad](https://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=783) math problem that requires reasoning. There are hundreds of these problems [available to prospective students](https://usaco.guide/problems/) - allowing them to sharpen their skills.
      1. I have this in a [PDF](./assets/USACO.pdf) format. I want it to extract the problem statement and solve it, and then write up an explanation for me of that solution.
      1. Then I want it to think of a better way to explain this visually by writing code that could generate a diagram or image that helps whiteboard this for visual learners.

## 1. Select Model

1. Select the `o4-mini` model as the default model for this exercise

## 2. Set Clear Context

1. Describe your role or persona
1. Describe the model's primary goal
1. Provide it any clarifying instructions
1. **Copy the following into your system context**

```bash title="" linenums="0"
You are a math tutor.

You are helping a student prepare for the USA Computing Olympiad. 

You will extract the problem statement from the text provided and solve it. 

Then you will write up an explanation of the solution. 

Finally, you will think of a better way to explain this visually 
by writing code that could generate a diagram or 
image that helps whiteboard this for visual learners.
```

## 3. Set Model Prompt

- Expand the section below to view the prompt text
- Copy it into the prompt input for model 
- Execute the prompt. **What do you observe?**

      ```title="" linenums="0"

      Bessie the cow used to have such a nice view from her barn, looking across road at a set of two billboards advertising delicious looking cow feed. Unfortunately, one of these billboards has recently been updated so it now advertises "Farmer Larry's Lawnmowers". Bessie is not a fan of lawnmowers since their only purpose, as far as she can tell, is cutting back the grass in her field that she finds so tasty (if you haven't noticed, much of Bessie's thought process revolves around food).

      Fortunately, the remaining cow feed billboard is situated in front of the lawnmower billboard, potentially obscuring it.

      Bessie, determined to remove the offensive lawnmower billboard completely from her view, hatches a risky plan. She plans to steal a large rectangular tarp from the barn and sneak out late at night to cover the remaining portion of the lawnmower billboard, so that she can no longer see any part of it.

      Given the locations of the two billboards, please help Bessie compute the minimum area of the tarp she will need. Since the only tarps available in the barn are rectangular in size, Bessie observes that she may conceivably need a tarp whose area is slightly larger than the exposed area of the lawnmower billboard, as illustrated in the example below. The tarp may only be placed such that its sides are parallel to those of the other billboards (i.e., it cannot be "tilted").

      INPUT FORMAT (file billboard.in):
      The first line of input contains four space-separated integers: x1
      y1
      x2
      y2
      , where (x1,y1)
      and (x2,y2)
      are the coordinates of the lower-left and upper-right corners of the lawnmower billboard in Bessie's 2D field of view. The next line contains four more integers, similarly specifying the lower-left and upper-right corners of the cow feed billboard. The cow feed billboard may obscure all, some, or none of the lawnmower billboard. All coordinates are in the range -1000 to +1000.
      OUTPUT FORMAT (file billboard.out):
      Please output the minimum area of the tarp Bessie needs to use to cover part of the lawnmower billboard so that it becomes completely obscured.
      SAMPLE INPUT:
      2 1 7 4
      5 -1 10 3
      SAMPLE OUTPUT:
      15
      Here, the cow feed billboard obscures the lower right corner of the lawnmower billboard, but this doesn't really help, since Bessie still needs to use a tarp whose size is as large as the entire lawnmower billboard.

## 4. Analyze Results

   1. You may see a response like this.
   1. **Note the Cost in tokens** e.g., `2477` tokens - is that acceptable?
   1. **Did the response meet your request?** e.g., is it visual?
   1. **Can you improve the response?** e.g., get it to draw this as an image

      Problem (“Blocked Billboard”)
      ————————————
      Bessie the cow used to have such a nice view from her barn, looking across the road at two billboards advertising delicious cow feed. One of these billboards has recently been updated and now advertises “Farmer Larry’s Lawnmowers.” Bessie dislikes lawnmowers and would like to completely obscure the offending lawnmower billboard from her view by placing one large rectangular tarp over whatever portion of it is still visible (the other billboard may already cover part of it).

      You are given the coordinates of the lower‐left and upper‐right corners of:

      the lawnmower billboard
      the cow‐feed billboard
      All rectangles are axis‐aligned. Compute the minimum area of a single axis‐aligned rectangular tarp that will cover all of the still‐visible portion of the lawnmower billboard. If the feed billboard already completely covers the lawnmower one, answer 0. If there is no overlap, you must cover the entire lawnmower billboard.

      Input (billboard.in)
      Line 1: x1 y1 x2 y2 — lawnmower billboard corners
      Line 2: x3 y3 x4 y4 — feed billboard corners
      (–1000 ≤ all coords ≤ +1000)

      Output (billboard.out)
      A single integer: the minimum tarp area needed.

      Sample Input
      2 1 7 4
      5 –1 10 3

      Sample Output
      15

      Explanation of the sample:

      Lawn mower billboard spans (2,1) to (7,4) → area = 5×3 = 15.
      Feed billboard spans (5,–1) to (10,3), which overlaps the lower right corner of the mower but does not cover it fully in either dimension.
      The remaining visible portions of the mower are in two disconnected pieces, so any single rectangle that contains both must be as large as the entire mower (area 15).

      ————————————
      Solution Outline
      ————————————
      Let
      mower = [X1,Y1]×[X2,Y2],
      feed = [A1,B1]×[A2,B2].
      Compute mower width and height:
      W = X2 – X1
      H = Y2 – Y1
      Full mower area = W × H.

      Compute overlap dimensions:
      overlap_width = max(0, min(X2,A2) – max(X1,A1))
      overlap_height = max(0, min(Y2,B2) – max(Y1,B1))
      If overlap_width == 0 or overlap_height == 0, there is no intersection → tarp must cover whole mower → answer = W×H.

      If the feed fully covers the mower:
      A1 ≤ X1, A2 ≥ X2, B1 ≤ Y1, and B2 ≥ Y2
      → answer = 0.

      Otherwise there is a partial overlap. The only time you can cover the remaining visible piece with less area than the full mower is when the feed “clips” off exactly one side (top, bottom, left, or right), leaving one contiguous rectangle. Concretely:
      • If feed’s x‐interval covers mower’s full width (A1 ≤ X1 and A2 ≥ X2), then feed is a horizontal strip.
      – If it touches the bottom of the mower (B1 ≤ Y1 < B2 < Y2), it clips off the bottom → one piece remains at top of height Y2–B2, so tarp area = W × (Y2–B2).
      – If it touches the top of the mower (Y1 < B1 < Y2 ≤ B2), it clips off the top → one piece remains at bottom of height B1–Y1, so tarp area = W × (B1–Y1).

      • Else if feed’s y‐interval covers mower’s full height (B1 ≤ Y1 and B2 ≥ Y2), then feed is a vertical strip.
      – If it touches the left side (A1 ≤ X1 < A2 < X2), tarp area = H × (X2–A2).
      – If it touches the right side (X1 < A1 < X2 ≤ A2), tarp area = H × (A1–X1).

      Otherwise the feed sits “in the middle” of the mower leaving two or more disconnected pieces → the minimal enclosing rectangle is the entire mower → area = W×H.

      Putting it all together, compute these cases and take the minimum area you find.

      Sample Implementation (C++‐style pseudocode)
      ————————————


      read X1,Y1,X2,Y2  
      read A1,B1,A2,B2  
      
      W = X2 - X1  
      H = Y2 - Y1  
      fullArea = W * H  
      
      // compute overlap  
      ovW = max(0, min(X2,A2) - max(X1,A1))  
      ovH = max(0, min(Y2,B2) - max(Y1,B1))  
      
      // no intersection  
      if (ovW == 0 or ovH == 0)   
      print fullArea and exit  
      
      // feed covers mower completely  
      if (A1 <= X1 and A2 >= X2 and B1 <= Y1 and B2 >= Y2)   
      print 0 and exit  
      
      ans = fullArea  
      
      // horizontal strip case  
      if (A1 <= X1 and A2 >= X2) {  
      // bottom strip  
      if (B1 <= Y1 and B2 < Y2)   
         ans = min(ans, W * (Y2 - B2))  
      // top strip  
      if (B2 >= Y2 and B1 > Y1)   
         ans = min(ans, W * (B1 - Y1))  
      }  
      
      // vertical strip case  
      if (B1 <= Y1 and B2 >= Y2) {  
      // left strip  
      if (A1 <= X1 and A2 < X2)    
         ans = min(ans, H * (X2 - A2))  
      // right strip  
      if (A2 >= X2 and A1 > X1)    
         ans = min(ans, H * (A1 - X1))  
      }  
      
      print ans  
      
      Time complexity is O(1) and uses only a few comparisons and arithmetic operations.

      How to use the script:
      • Change the mower and feed tuples to any coordinates you like.
      • Run python visualize.py (assuming you save it that name).
      • You’ll see a plot showing how the feed covers the mower and exactly what tarp you need.

      This visual should make it crystal‐clear in each case why the tarp can sometimes be smaller (a single clipped side), or otherwise must cover the full lawnmower billboard.
