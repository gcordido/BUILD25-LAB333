# LAB333: Evaluate Reasoning Models for Your Generative AI Solutions


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This repository contains training materials for a hands-on workshop on Reasoning models. It provides an overview of reasoning models (what they are, how they work, when to use them) and illustrates tradeoffs and best practices for usage with examples.

## Workshop Overview

Reasoning models excel at complex problem-solving tasks and nuanced analysis that benefit from multi-step analysis or processing - as opposed to simple question-answering. So, how do you know if a reasoning model is the right fit for _your_ scenario? In this workshop, we'll take you from core concepts to code-based exploration of reasoning models on Azure AI Foundry.

- **Duration:** 75-mins
- **Level:** Beginner/Intermediate

## Learning Objectives

This workshop is designed to jumpstart your journey into understanding, and working with, reasoning models in generative AI. By the end of the journey you should be able to:

1. Explain what reasoning models are, and how they work
1. Deploy and explore reasoning models using Azure AI Foundry and GitHub
1. Build intution for usage with low-code and code-first approaches
1. Gain insights into patterns and practices for practical applications


## Pre-Requisites

1. Python 3.10 or higher (runtime)
1. Azure account (with active subscription and model quota)
1. GitHub account (with GitHub Codespaces quota)
1. Familiarity with Python programming & Jupyter notebooks
1. Familiarity with VS Code editors & commandline usage
1. Familiarity with Generative AI applications and concepts

## Delivery Formats

This lab is designed for two kinds of audiences:

1. **Instructor-led** 路 This is for 75-minute in-venue sessions at Microsoft Build. Particpants will use a pre-provisioned Azure subscription 路 Bring your own laptop.
1. **Self-guided** - This is for self-guided learners 路 Bring your own Azure subscription and laptop 路 Work at your own pace.


## Quickstart

We recommend using GitHub Codespaces for the fastest start with minimal effort.

1. Fork the repo to your personal GitHub account to get your own copy
1. Launch GitHub Codespaces and work with a VS Code editor in the browser
1. Open a VS Code terminal when ready, run command to preview the lab guide

    ```bash
    mkdocs serve
    ```
    
1. Work through the instructions in GitHub Codespaces.
