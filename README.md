# LAB333: Evaluate Reasoning Models for Your Generative AI Solutions


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This repository contains training materials for a hands-on workshop on Reasoning models. It provides an overview of reasoning models (what they are, how they work, when to use them) and illustrates tradeoffs and best practices for usage with examples.

## Workshop Overview

Reasoning models excel at complex problem-solving tasks and nuanced analysis that benefit from multi-step analysis or processing - as opposed to simple question-answering. So, how do you know if a reasoning model is the right fit for _your_ scenario? In this workshop, we'll take you from core concepts to code-based exploration of reasoning models on Azure AI Foundry.

- **Duration:** 75-mins
- **Level:** Beginner/Intermediate

## Learning Objectives

This workshop is designed to jumpstart your journey into understanding, and working with, reasoning models in generative AI. By the end of the journey you should be able to:

1. Explain what reasoning models are, and how they work
1. Deploy and explore reasoning models using Azure AI Foundry and GitHub
1. Build intution for usage with low-code and code-first approaches
1. Gain insights into patterns and practices for practical applications

## Quickstart 

1. Fork the repo to your personal GitHub account to get your own copy
1. Launch GitHub Codespaces and work with a VS Code editor in the browser
1. Open a VS Code terminal when ready, run ```mkdocs serve```
1. Work through the instructions in GitHub Codespaces.
